Sample Script
==========================================

Input
^^^^^^^^^^

Below is an example of using the CLI scripting commands to define and execute a simple test. A file containing these commands can simply be uploaded to a chassis using the XenaScriptingClient.

.. literalinclude:: /overview/code-examples/sample_input.txt
    :linenos:
    :caption: sample_input.txt

Output
^^^^^^^^^^

Below you can download a file containing the output generated by the chassis when it receives the commands shown in the previous section. A dump like this can be obtained and saved using the Xena Script Client.

You need to do a line-by-line correlation of the two lists in order to fully understand the output.

.. note:: 
    
    There are sections of blank lines in the output corresponding to the comment lines in the input.
