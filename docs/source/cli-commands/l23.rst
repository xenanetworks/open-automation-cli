L23 Commands (Valkyrie)
==========================================

Chassis Commands
---------------------

``C_LOGON``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: shell

    # set
    C_LOGON <password>

:Description:
    You log on to the chassis by setting the parameter of this command to the correct password for the chassis. All other commands will fail if the session has not been logged on.

:Actions:
    set

:Parameter:
    ``password: <string>``, password for creating a tester management session and logging on to the tester.

:Example:
    .. code-block:: shell

        # set
        input:  C_LOGON "xena"
        output: <OK>


``C_OWNER``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: shell

    # set
    C_OWNER <username>

    # get
    C_OWNER ?

:Description:
    Identify the owner of the management session. The name can be any short quoted
    string up to eight characters long. This name will be used when reserving ports
    prior to updating their configuration. There is no authentication of the users,
    and the chassis does not have any actual user accounts. Multiple concurrent
    connections may use the same owner name, but only one connection can have any
    particular resource reserved at any given time. Until an owner is specified the
    chassis configuration can only be read. Once specified, the session can reserve
    ports for that owner, and will inherit any existing reservations for that owner
    retained at the chassis. Maximum 32 ASCII characters.

:Actions:
    set, get

:Parameter:
    ``username: <string>``, the username of this chassis management session.

:Example:
    .. code-block:: shell

        # set
        input:  C_OWNER "alice"
        output: <OK>

        # get
        input:  C_OWNER ?
        output: C_OWNER "alice"


``C_KEEPALIVE``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: shell

    # get
    C_KEEPALIVE ?

:Description:
    You can request this parameter from the chassis, simply to let it (as well as and
    any routers and proxies between you) know that the connection is still valid.

:Actions:
    get

:Parameter:
    ``tick_count: <int>``, an increasing number from the chassis.

:Example:
    .. code-block:: shell

        # get
        input:  C_KEEPALIVE ?
        output: C_KEEPALIVE 12345


Module Commands
---------------------

``M_RESERVATION``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: shell

    # set
    <module-index> M_RESERVATION <operation>

    # get
    <module-index> M_RESERVATION ?

:Description:
    Set this command to reserve, release, or relinquish a module itself (as
    opposed to its ports). The module must be reserved before its hardware image can
    be upgraded. The owner of the session must already have been specified.
    Reservation will fail if the chassis or any ports are reserved for other users.

:Actions:
    set, get

:Parameter:
    ``operation: <byte>``, containing the operation to perform. ``[RELEASE (0) | RESERVE (1) | RELINQUISH (2)]``. The reservation commands are asymmetric with respect to set/get. When set, it contains the operation to perform. When get, it contains the status ``[ RELEASED (0) | RESERVED_BY_YOU (1) | RESERVED_BY_OTHER (2) ]``.

:Example:
    .. code-block:: shell

        # set
        input:  0 M_RESERVATION M_RESERVATION
        output: <OK>

        # get
        input:  0 M_RESERVATION ?
        output: 0 M_RESERVATION RESERVED_BY_YOU


Port Commands
---------------------

``P_SPEEDREDUCTION``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: shell

    # set
    <module-index>/<port-index> P_SPEEDREDUCTION <ppm>

    # get
    <module-index>/<port-index> P_SPEEDREDUCTION ?

:Description:
    A speed reduction applied to the transmitting side of a port, resulting in an
    effective traffic rate that is slightly lower than the rate of the physical
    interface. Speed reduction is effectuated by inserting short idle periods in the
    generated traffic pattern to consume part of the port's physical bandwidth. The
    port's clock speed is not altered.

:Actions:
    set, get

:Parameter:
    ``ppm: <int>``, specifying the speed reduction in units of parts-per-million.

:Example:
    .. code-block:: shell

        # set
        input:  0/1 P_SPEEDREDUCTION 100
        output: <OK>

        # get
        input:  0/1 P_SPEEDREDUCTION ?
        output: 0/1 P_SPEEDREDUCTION 100


Stream Commands
---------------------

``PS_COMMENT``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: shell

    # set
    <module-index>/<port-index> PS_COMMENT <[stream-index]> <comment>

    # get
    <module-index>/<port-index> PS_COMMENT <[stream-index]> ?

:Description:
    The description of a stream.

:Actions:
    set, get

:Parameter:
    ``comment: <string>``, specifying the description of a stream.

:Example:
    .. code-block:: shell

        # set
        input:  0/1 PS_COMMENT [0] "this is comment"
        output: <OK>

        # get
        input:  0/1 PS_COMMENT [0] ?
        output: 0/1 PS_COMMENT [0] "this is comment"
